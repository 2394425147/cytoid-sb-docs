# Setup

To be able to write storyboards more efficiently, you'll need a **text editor** to format the code, as well as **CytoidPlayer**, to play the storyboard as you code.

For the text editor, most people use [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com). It has a simple interface and a small install size.

For **CytoidPlayer**, you can find the latest Windows version [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1skBP8u\_LTDloTxXr3cVl8YdJzmgMkywi/view?usp=sharing). A Mac version will be available soon. (However, if you're fine with a fallback version, you can download an earlier Mac build [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463438558544265247/529517721231163392/CytoidPlayer\_1.5.2.app.zip))
