# What's a Storyboard?

Storyboards add extra behavior to a chart. You can use it to hide the UI, move the notes, spin the camera, and more. Check out how osu! explains it [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Storyboard).

In Cytoid, storyboards are written in the [**JSON** ](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)format to represent all of the animations.
