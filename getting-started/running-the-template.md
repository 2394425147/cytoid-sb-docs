# Running the Template

Open CytoidPlayer.exe, and close it.

<summary>Why do I need to close it?</summary>

This allows CytoidPlayer to automatically create the folders necessary to use your custom levels.&#x20;

You _can_ create the folders yourself, but we open CytoidPlayer here to be more convenient.

Download the [AmazingBomb starter kit](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wb4zfmfa0s8pict/AmazingBomb.zip?dl=0), and unzip it to `C:/Users/<Username>/AppData/LocalLow/TigerHix/Cytoid/player`. The files should be directly placed inside the `player` folder.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Mac" %}
Open Terminal, and type `open ~/Library/Application\ Support`.

Create the folder at `/TigerHix/Cytoid/player`.
